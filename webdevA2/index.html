                    <h3>sea dogs</h3>
                    <p>prior to the 16th century, sharks were more commonly known as <span class="italics">sea dogs</span>, 
                        something still evidential in various species of sharks, such as dogfish and porbeagles. 
                        they were given this name due to their habit of following ships in hopes that discarded food would be tossed into the water- 
                        with such persistence that they continued following even after sailors would try to scare them away.  </p>
                        </article>
                        <article>
                        <h3>sharks</h3>
                        <p>
                            the origin of the word <span class="italics">shark</span>, however, is still uncertain, but its most likely etymology states that the sense of the word was that of
                             "predator, one who preys on others" originating from the dutch word <span class="italics">schurk</span>, 
                            meaning "villain, scoundrel" (see the use of the word as in "card shark" or "loan shark").

                    <h3>living fossils</h3>
                    <p>sharks have been around for over 439 million years during the early silurian period- surpassing the first known human species, <span class="italics">sahelanthropus</span>, by about 433 million years! 
                    they were known as the acanthodians or "spiny sharks". the oldest confirmed members of 
                    elasmobranchii- the group containing all the cartilaginous fish more closely related to modern sharks and rays- appeared during the devonian period. 
                anachronistidae, the oldest probable representatives of euselachii- the group containing modern sharks (selachii) and rays (batomorphi) to the exclusion of most extinct elasmobranch groups, 
                date to the carboniferous period. it is said that selachii and batomorphi began to diverge during the triassic period- soon after, the first modern shark orders 
            appeared during the early jurassic period, where they would later undergo great diversification and replace the hybodonts who were previously a dominant group of shark-like fish.</p>

                    <h3>the most fearsome of them all</h3>
                    <p>
                        the <span class="italics">otodus megalodon</span>, more commonly known as megalodon, was a giant species of mackarel shark that ruled the oceans approximately 23 to 3.6 million years ago. 
                        thought to be a relative of the famous great white shark, it is actually part of the extinct family otodontidae, which diverged from the great white shark during the early cretaceous period. 
                        it is regarded as one of the greatest and most powerful predators to have ever lived.

                    <h3>cartilaginous skeleton</h3>
                    <p>unlike most fishes that have bony skeletons, a shark's skeleton is made out of cartilage. 
                        this is a flexible but strong connective tissue that's also found throughout the human body, 
                        in places like the nose, ears, and in joints between bones. sharks, rays, skates, and chimaeras 
                        all have cartilaginous skeletons. cartilage is less dense than bone, allowing sharks to move quickly through the water
                         without using too much energy.</p>

                    <h3>pectoral fins</h3>
                    <p>
                     while skates and rays also have cartilaginous skeletons, 
                     sharks have very different body shapes. a ray has flattened,
                      enlarged pectoral fins that make up its disc-shaped body. 
                      pectoral fins on sharks are located on both sides of its body, 
                      behind the gill slits. They help create lift as sharks move through the water, similar to an airplane's wings. 
                      sharks that linger near the ocean floor, like nurse sharks, may even use these fins to prop themselves up: 
                      they'll make the space below their bodies look like fake caves to draw in prey like crabs.
                    </p>
                </article>
                                <article>
                    <h3>gill slits</h3>
                    <p>
                    while bony fishes have one gill opening on each side of its body,
                     sharks have five to seven. the gills of bony fishes are also hidden
                      behind flaps that open and close, whereas sharks have exposed gill slits.
                       and the belief that sharks have to keep swimming constantly in order to breathe isn't entirely true.
                        some species of shark use “ram ventilation,” which means they get oxygen to their gills by swimming 
                        rapidly with their mouths open for the water to flow through. other sharks are less active bottom-dwellers that have spiracles, 
                        or openings behind the eyes, to pull water in and past the gills.

                    <h3>oily liver</h3>
                    <p>
                    bony fishes have bladders filled with air that help them stay afloat.
                     a shark, however, has a very large liver that could make up 25 percent of its entire weight. 
                     the liver is filled with oil that helps the shark stay buoyant. 
                     sharks store fat in their liver, which is important for migrating long distances.
                      in fact, a well-fed shark stays afloat more easily than a lean one: more fat in the liver means more buoyancy.

                    <h3>dermal denticles</h3>
                    <p>
                   these tiny scales got their name because they look a lot like sharp teeth:
                    dermal denticle actually means “skin tooth.” 
                    covering a shark's skin, dermal denticles are part of what makes these predators such a stealthy hunter. 
                    they are useful for reducing drag in the water and increasing speed—shortfin mako sharks can swim at speeds over 30 miles per hour! 
                    denticles even inspire the designs of olympic swimsuits.

                      bull sharks have the strongest bite force of all known living shark species!

                      are extremely territorial and are known for being capable of surviving in both
                       freshwater and saltwater environment.

                       responsible for most of the shark attacks on humans. 
                       a powerful apex predator, this shark is the largest living macropredatory

                      the dwarf lanternshark is the smallest species of shark in the world,
                       growing only up to 15-20cm in length. these deep sea sharks are bioluminescent, 
                       which means that their bodies are capable of producing light! 
                       this helps them camouflage in sunlight and shimmer in shallow waters, 
                       allowing them to hide from predators. as with many other deep sea sharks, not much is known about them.

                      whale sharks are the largest living fish in the ocean, 
                      measuring up to 19 meters in length. that's longer than a schoolbus!
                      these gentle giants are filter feeders, 
                      which means that they only feed on tiny animals such as krill and plankton.

                      the basking shark is the second largest living fish in the ocean. 
                      similarly to whale sharks, they are also filter feeders. 
                      despite this shark's large size, scientists have observed basking sharks 
                      swimming fast enough to be able to jump out of the water.

                      round chunk out of larger fish, which leave them mostly unhurt. cookiecutter sharks were first

                      to have six pairs of gills. when hunting food, the frilled shark curls its tail against a rock 
                      and moves like an eel, bending and lunging to capture and swallow whole prey with its long
                       and flexible jaws, which are equipped with 300 recurved, needle-like teeth.

                      the goblin shark is often unfairly regarded as the ugliest shark in the world. 
                      however, most images that support this fact are actually pictures of the shark 
                      in the middle of eating. in reality, goblin sharks look pretty similar to the 
                      average shark, save for it's goblin like nose and semi-translucent skin.

                      estimated to be around 250 to 500 years. they are stealth hunters that actually 
                      swim so slowly, they don't produce a pressure wave that prey might pick up. not much is 
                      known about these mysterious creatures due to the depth and freezing temperatures
                       of their preferred environment.

                    <h3>humans kill millions of sharks every year</h3>
                    <p>the 1975 film <span class="italics">jaws</span> had a significant impact on the public
                         perception of sharks, much of it negative.
                          the film depicted a rogue great white shark 
                          as a ferocious and mindless man-eater, and this portrayal 
                          has persisted in popular culture to this day. the film's
                           depiction of sharks as fearsome predators that 
                           attack humans for no apparent reason led to a widespread fear of sharks, 
                           and many people believe still that all sharks are dangerous to humans.
                            in california, the film led to vendetta killings, 
                            great white shark tournaments,
                             a commercial fishery that along with bycatch in a gillnet fishery,
                              almost completely wiped out the population of white sharks along
                               the west coast of north america. 
                               it's significant to note that the negative portrayal of sharks in 
                               “jaws” has had real-world consequences.
                                sports fishermen catch and display sharks without regard to cruelty. 
                                coastal ocean goers ignorant about true shark behavior
                                 and relative risk are overly fearful of sharks,
                                  and this perception can generate overly-reactive public 
                                  policy in the event of a (rare) attack on a human. 
                                  the general attitude about sharks has led from a general 
                                  disregard and mismanagement of sharks in fisheries
                                   to an outright vilification of these apex predators.
                                    for example, shark fisheries and finning have become
                                     major issues facing shark populations globally,
                                      and as a result, many shark species are facing 
                                      huge population declines with little public attention.
                                       additionally, the negative perception of sharks 
                                       has made it difficult for conservation efforts 
                                       to gain traction in some areas, as many people are
                                        reluctant to support measures to protect these
                                         important animals.

    over 500 species of sharks are not dangerous to humans, 
    and only a few species have been involved in serious or fatal attacks on humans.
     in fact, many species of sharks are endangered, 
     with over 70% of all sharks and rays fished out, 
     yet they play a crucial role in maintaining healthy ocean ecosystems.

                    <h3>what is it?</h3>
                    <p>
                        shark finning is the act of removing fins from sharks
                         and discarding the rest of the shark back into the ocean. 
                         this act is prohibited in many countries. the sharks are 
                         often still alive when discarded, but without their fins. unable
                          to swim effectively, they sink to the bottom of the ocean and die
                           of suffocation or are eaten by other predators. shark finning at
                            sea enables fishing vessels to increase profitability and increase
                             the number of sharks harvested, as they must only store and 
                             transport the fins, by far the most profitable part of the shark; 
                             the shark meat is bulky to transport. many countries have banned
                              this practice and require the whole shark to be brought back to port
                               before removing the fins.
                    </p>
                </article>
                <article >
                    <h3>why is it bad?</h3>
                    <p>
                        many fishermen prefer to practice shark finning instead
                         of bringing whole sharks to the market because the fins 
                         are far more valuable than the rest of the body, sometimes
                          selling for as much as $500 a pound ($1,100 a kilogram). 
                          instead, fishermen choose to keep just the shark fins—
                          only one to five percent of a shark's weight—and throw
                           the rest of the shark away rather than have the less 
                           valuable parts take up space on the boat. the finned
                            sharks are often thrown back into the ocean alive,
                             where they do not die peacefully: unable to swim properly 
                             and bleeding profusely, they suffocate or die of blood loss.

<p>
however, 
the animal cruelty 
implications are not
 the only reason to stop
  this practice. another major factor
   is that shark fisheries—and finning in particular—
   are having catastrophic effects on shark populations 
   around the world. approximately 100 million sharks are killed globally each year,
    and one of the major incentives for this is the shark fin trade. with their slow growth 
    and low reproductive rates, sharks are highly susceptible to extinction,
     and it is difficult for many shark species to replenish their populations 
     as quickly as they are being diminished. many species of sharks are currently 
     in danger due to shark finning, including the scalloped hammerhead, 
     which is endangered, and the smooth hammerhead, which is vulnerable 
     according to the international union for the conservation of nature.
      between 1.3 and 2.7 million of just these two sharks are killed every year
       in the shark fin trade, and the northwestern atlantic population of the 
       scalloped hammerhead declined from around 155,500 in 1981 to 26,500 in 2005.
        today, some shark populations have decreased by 60-70% due to human shark fisheries.

                    <p>only about a dozen of the more than 300 species
                         of sharks have been involved in attacks on humans. 
                         sharks evolved millions of years before humans 
                         existed and therefore humans are not part of their normal diets.
                          sharks are opportunistic feeders, but most sharks primarily feed 
                          on smaller fish and invertebrates. some of the larger shark species
                           prey on seals, sea lions, and other marine mammals. 
                           sharks have been known to attack humans
                            when they are confused or curious.
                             if a shark sees a human splashing in the water, 
                             it may try to investigate, leading to an accidental attack.

    to a juvenile white shark- the sharks responsible for the majority of shark attacks,
     when humans swim and paddle surfboards, they bear a strong resemblance to seals and sealions. Additionally, most sharks 
     are likely colourblind- and main distinguish objects based off its silhouette.

                <p>
                   as apex predators, sharks play an important role
                    in the ecosystem by maintaining the species 
                    below them in the food chain and serving as an
                     indicator for ocean health. they help remove the
                      weak and the sick as well as keeping the balance
                       with competitors helping to ensure species diversity.
                </p>
                <img alt="shark" src="images/importantshark.png">
                <p>
                    as predators, they shift their prey's spatial habitat,
                     which alters the feeding strategy and diets of other
                      species. through the spatial controls and abundance,
                       sharks indirectly maintain the seagrass  and corals 
                       reef habitats. the loss of sharks has led to the decline
                        in coral reefs, seagrass beds and the loss of commercial fisheries.
                         by taking sharks out of the coral reef ecosystem, the larger predatory
                          fish, such as groupers, increase in abundance and feed on the herbivores.
                           with less herbivores, macroalgae expands and coral can no longer
                            compete, shifting the ecosystem to one of algae dominance,
                             affecting the survival of the reef system.

                <p>
                    overfishing is one of the biggest threats to sharks. many times, sharks are caught accidentally. this is known as 
                    a by-catch. while fishermen try to catch other species such as swordfish or tuna, 
                    sharks are frequently caught in their nets instead- and unfortunately for them, many shark species need to be constantly 
                    moving in order to breathe, resulting in many dying shortly after being released.

                <h3>purchase responsibly</h3>
                <p>
                   not all types of fisheries have the same amount of by-catch.
                    a certain type of fishing, called pelagic longlining, has been 
                    found to be one of the worst in terms of by-catch. longline
                     fisheries typically set out to catch species such as yellowfin,
                      bluefin and skipjack tuna, as well as swordfish. currently,
                       the vast majority of these fisheries aren't managed sustainably,
                        but lots of work is being done to reduce by-catch and improve sustainability.
                         you can support this by being responsible in what you eat.
                  if you are buying tuna or tuna-like fish, 
                  check the tin. look for mentions of 'sustainably caught'  and of gear type. 
                  you can also check out initiatives like the marine stewardship council
                   blue fish label, which certifies that a product has been fished in a sustainable
                    and well-managed way. tuna caught by pole-and-line 
                    is the most sustainable in terms of having the least by-catch.
                     by avoiding tuna, or by buying sustainably caught tuna, you're
                      helping to reduce the number of sharks that are accidentally 
                      caught and killed by fishing vessels on the high seas. at the end
                       of the day, without sharks, the whole marine environment 
                       wouldn't be as healthy and there would be far less fish in the sea to eat!

                <p>
                    shark fins have low nutritional value, have no taste, are expensive,
                    and have no proven medicinal value. in fact, they contain high levels of mercury 
                    (made more concentrated by the treating and drying process),
                     plus hydrogen peroxide, which is used to make the colour more appealing. 
                     worst of all, many sharks have their fins cut off and get thrown back into the ocean, where without their fins, will sink 
                     to the bottom of the seafloor and die a slow and painful death. on the otherhand, humans don't need shark fins
                     to survive, but sharks do.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                     say no to shark fin soup. without consumers, the shark fin industry will die down.

                <p>
                    after the release of the movie "Jaws", the perception of sharks began to twist into that of 
                    a mindless killing machine that actively seeks to kill humans. this is not true in the slightest and a dangerous 
                    idea to have- the fear of sharks was on the rise and led to many shark-fishing competitions; since then, many 
                    sharks have become endangered. it's important to remember that these are wild animals. in no way are they soft 
                    cuddly teddy bears, but they are not mindless killing machines either! we need to respect sharks as the majestic creatures they are, and 
                    as an important part of the ecosystem.
